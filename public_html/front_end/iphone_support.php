		<h1>Freestuff iphone App</h1>
		
		<p>If you are reading this, we have finally finished our iphone app.  The Freestuff Quicklist app allows you to easily items on freestuff.co.nz.  </p>
		
		<p>If you don't have a freestuff account, you can create one  <a href="register">here</a>.  Use the same account to log into the iphone app</p>
		
		<p>Once you have logged into the iphone app, simply click the "list an item" button.  From the list an item screen, you simply shoot a photo, type in a title and short description for your item, then save it.  Easy</p>
