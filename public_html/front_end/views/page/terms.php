                    <b>The receiver must be able to collect the goods at no cost to the receiver.</b>
                    It is acceptable to expect the receiver to have to extract the goods. This must be clearly stated in the listing.
                </p>

                <p>
                For example, if you are giving away parts of a house, such as windows or bricks, the giver can insist the receiver bring appropriate tools to remove the items.
                <br />
                The giver may offer to post or deliver the item and it is acceptable for the receiver to pay for this.  This should be clearly stated in the postage details for the item.
