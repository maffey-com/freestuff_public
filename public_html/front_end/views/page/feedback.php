                <p class="answer">If you collect many negative feedbacks, you are unlikely to be offered items in the future.
                Also, feedback affects how many items you can request in a month.  When you receive a negative feedback, you will loose 2 request credits.  A positive feedback will gain you 2 request credits.</p>
