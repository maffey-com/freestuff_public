    <h1 class="my-3">Freestuff is going offline</h1>


    <p>
        After <b>30th November 2025</b>, Freestuff will no longer be available in this form. We will be winding down the
        website and app.
    </p>
    <p>
        It is a tricky decision, on one hand, Freestuff is established and works, helping people
        find new homes for unwanted items.</p>
    <p>
        On the other hand, every morning when I check the site, I dream up a long list of improvements and new features
        that I would love to build, but just don't have the time or energy to do so.  As many business owners will attest, it is easy to discount the time and effort you sink into your own project.
    </p>
    <p>
        Compared with when we started Freestuff,  there are now many options for people to give away unwanted items, including Facebook Marketplace, Neighbourly, and various local community groups.
        While Freestuff has some unique features, it is hard to compete with the scale and convenience of these larger platforms.
